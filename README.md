## FAQ

### Why isn't there any background music?

The code for background music is already there (including appropriate loop points!). However, I won't distribute the game's music with it, as I feel it would be a blatant infringement of copyright. 

If you happen to have Chrono Trigger's OST as mp3 files, include the following songs (with these exact names) in the game's **sound** folder.

- Battle 1.mp3 (originally "Battle") 
- Battle 2.mp3
- Battle With Magus.mp3
- Black Dream.mp3
- Boss Battle.mp3
- Boss Battle 2.mp3
- Confusing Melody.mp3
- Critical Moment.mp3 (also known as "A Shot of Crisis")
- Fanfare 1.mp3
- The Brink of Time.mp3
- The Trial.mp3
- Tyranno Lair.mp3
- Undersea Palace.mp3
- Wings That Cross Time.mp3
- World Revolution.mp3
