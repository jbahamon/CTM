# Installation and Configuration

CTM is based, as the name suggests, on the
[MUGEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.U.G.E.N) fighting game engine. You just download it and run the `mugen/mugen.exe` file to launch the game.


## Music

The code for background music is already there (including appropriate loop points). However, the game's music is not included to avoid blatant copyright issues. 

If you happen to have Chrono Trigger's OST as mp3 files, include the following songs (with these exact names) in the `mugen/docs` folder.

- Battle 1.mp3 (originally "Battle") 
- Battle 2.mp3
- Battle With Magus.mp3
- Black Dream.mp3
- Boss Battle.mp3
- Boss Battle 2.mp3
- Confusing Melody.mp3
- Critical Moment.mp3 (also known as "A Shot of Crisis")
- Fanfare 1.mp3
- The Brink of Time.mp3
- The Trial.mp3
- Tyranno Lair.mp3
- Undersea Palace.mp3
- Wings That Cross Time.mp3
- World Revolution.mp3
