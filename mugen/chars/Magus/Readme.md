Magus by SilentProtagonist 
=============================

Magus is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's Missing:

- More palettes.
- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)

Magus was a bit difficult to (re)create in MUGEN, so I had to take a few 
liberties. 

First, he has few original techs (he has Lightning/Ice/Fire 2 using up three 
of his tech "slots") so I went and used non-CT material as an inspiration. 
Specifically, Shadow Walk and Black Wind are based on Radical 
Dreamers' description of some of Magil's abilities. I hope you like them!

Then, after that, there's the fact that most of Magus' original techs 
(Dark Bomb, Dark Mist and Dark Matter) are basically big projectiles. I 
actually can't properly rip Dark Mist because of the ripply effect. 
Therefore, I changed Dark Mist to a physical move, inspired in one of 
Deathscythe's attacks (from Gundam Wing: Endless Duel). Both Magus and 
Deathscythe have scythes, so I think it fits.

Finally, I used the Lightning/Ice/Fire side of his tech list to make 
him a "stance" character. I changed Ice to Water because the element icon 
from the DS games shows a water drop.


Magus' Moveset
==============

Magus is good at combos. He walks slow, but runs fast. His strong hit 
is a good launcher, so throw your opponent into the air and either bring 
it down or wait for it to fall into your next attack.

In addition to this, Magus has three "magic modes": Light, Water and Fire. 
Your current magic mode affects some of your moves' damage and behavior. You 
can switch between magic modes by pressing Start/Taunt. The cycle goes 
Light -> Water -> Fire -> Light again. An icon will appear over Magus' head to
indicate the new magic mode.

Throws
--------------

**Magic Bind**: F/B + (a+b)/(b+c)/(a+c)  (Standing).

Magus casts some magic to damage his opponent. The type of magic used 
depends on your current magic mode. The differences, however, are 
merely cosmetic.

**Black Hole**: B, D, DB + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 500 Power.

Magus creates a black hole under him that will absorb the first 
enemy that it touches. Has good range, but can be slow and 
punishable.


Specials
--------

**Shadow Walk Forwards**: F, D, DF + (a+b)/(b+c) (Standing).

Magus vanishes into the shadows, gaining invulnerability, and 
advances towards the opponent. a+b version is shorter, b+c is longer.

**Shadow Walk Forwards**: B, D, DB + (a+b)/(b+c) (Standing).

Magus vanishes into the shadows, gaining invulnerability, 
and gets away from the opponent. a+b version is shorter, b+c is longer.

**Dark Mist**: F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing).

Magus jumps into the air, doing three spinning slashes with his scythe.
The angle and speed of this attack depends on the button used.

**Elemental Magic**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing).

Magus casts a basic spell using his current magic mode. 

Light summons a lightning that falls at a distance that depends on 
the button pressed. Hard to hit with and less damage than the others,
but has good range and speed.

Water creates a small bubble that travels a short distance and stays 
in the air for a bit. The angle of the bubble's trajectory depends on 
the button pressed.

Fire throws a flame. The speed and angle depends on the button. Does 
the most damage of these three.

See the Special Mode section for details on what happens to this move 
during it.


Supers
------

**Dark Matter**: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Magus releases the ultimate Shadow magic, creating a wicked tear in spacetime
that moves forward.

**Hell's Geyser**: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing/Air). Requires 1000 Power.

Magus creates a geyser that emits souls. The button used determines the position
of the geyser. Does little damage but is big and allows for nice combos.

**Black Wind**: D, F, D, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Magus summons the Black Wind, running towards his opponent and cutting him countless times.
This is a throw move: don't try it on unthrowable characters.


Special Mode
------------

**Magic Wall**: a + c (Standing). Requires 3000 Power.

Magus raises his Magic Defense. While his Magic Wall is up, Magus is 
immune to projectile damage, and all projectile attacks are automatically 
countered with a small projectile.

Additionally, Magus' magic mode switches to his true element, Shadow. 
His Elemental Magic (D, DF, F + a/b/c) changes to casting Dark Bomb. 
The Dark Bomb's position depends on the button pressed.

Your Power will automatically decrease: when you run out of Power, this mode ends.

Final Move
----------

**Midnight Blackness**: D, F, D, B + a/b/c (Standing, must have Magic Wall activated). Uses all of your Power, ending Magic Wall.

A super throw. Magus advances towards its opponent. If he hits them, he 
transforms them into an "alternate form" (depends on the character, you'll see)
and drains some of their energy, healing himself a bit. "Come on, baby", indeed.
