Robo by SilentProtagonist 
================================

Robo is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's Missing:

- More palettes.
- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)

Robo was fun to make. He has many ground moves and funny poses. Still, I 
wanted to give him something that made him unique and different from other
characters. I also saw he had a hard time getting close to his opponents.
The thrusters idea solved (I hope!) both of these issues. 


Robo's Moveset
==============

Robo is a slow character. He hits hard but can't combo very well. 
His supers have a medium range, but it can be hard to combo into them if your 
opponent runs away.

This changes when he activates his thrusters.

He has a second jump thar works sort of like R.O.B.'s third jump in Super Smash Bros. 
Brawl (called Robo Burner). Quoting SmashWiki (http://www.ssbwiki.com/): 

"Although it deals no damage, it can be used, then deactivated for an attack,
then reactivated (...) Robo Burner relies on fuel, which automatically
charges when R.O.B. is touching the ground, taking about 1.5 seconds
to fully charge."

Robo's propulsors do not require any special command to use: just hold down
Up, Left or Right while jumping and Robo will fly in that direction. You can
also fly diagonally up.

In addition, Robo's medium punch, hard punch require and use up
some of your fuel (10% and 15%, respectively) to execute to its fullest. 
Other moves also require fuel, and will be noted in the following. Robo's 
air attacks are faster and more comboable. Robo has a fuel meter under him at all 
times so you can keep track of the amount you have.

This means Robo's fighting style switches between waiting for your fuel to recharge 
and rushing your opponent with air attacks. Use your thrusters to get close to your 
opponents!


Throws
--------------

**Robo Toss**: F/B + (a+b)/(b+c)/(a+c) (Standing)

A standard throw. Robo grabs the opponent, gives them a few spins and throws them away.
The direction you press determines the direction your opponent will be thrown.

**Robo Launcher**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Air). Requires 500 Power, 75% Fuel.

Robo uses his thrusters to quickly fly towards his opponent. He grabs his opponent, 
flies them into the air, turns them upside down, then crashes them into the ground.

Specials
--------

**Robo Tackle**: F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing)

Robo does a diagonal tackle into the air. The button used determines the
attack's trajectory and damage.

**Area Bomb**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing)

Robo stops and creates a small explosion around him. Use this to defend against
pressuring opponents.

**Rocket Punch**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing/Air) Requires 30% Fuel.

Robo sends his fist flying towards the opponent. The button used
determines the fist's speed. The air version can't be used if you 
don't have enough fuel.


Supers
------

**Shock**: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Similar to Area Bomb. Robo opens up and electrocutes anyone who comes too close.

**Uzzi Punch**: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Robo throws a multi-punch in front of him. The attack ends with a small explosion. 
Try comboing into this super move.

**Omega Laser**: ~D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Robo shoots a short-range laser towards the enemy.


Special Mode
------------

**Electrocute**: a+c (Standing). Requires 3000 Power.

Robo overloads and electric arcs appear around him. His thrusters are 
forcefully activated, so you'll be floating all the time. This means you 
can't use specials and supers that require you to be standing.

The high speed can be a little unwieldy, but take advantage of it.
You can also use any attack that requires fuel as many times as you want.

Your Power will automatically decrease: when you run out of Power, 
the mode ends. Go on the offensive!

Final Move
----------

**Prometheus Cannon**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (must have Electrocute activated). Uses all of your Power, ending Electrocute.

Robo pulls a big cannon out of nowhere, and shoots a huge beam 
of energy. Note that you'll achieve maximum damage with this move if you 
shoot at point-blank. Even better if your opponent is cornered. 

"Here's my Sunday best!"
