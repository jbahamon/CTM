Marle by SilentProtagonist 
================================

Marle is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's Missing:

- More palettes.
- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)

Robo was fun to make. He has many ground moves and funny poses. Still, I 
wanted to give him something that made him unique and different from other
characters. I also saw he had a hard time getting close to his opponents.
The thrusters idea solved (I hope!) both of these issues. 


Marle's Moveset
==============

Marle isn't too fast or strong, but she has a few quirks. She 
has a counter attack, can heal herself and has many projectiles. 
She has a decent air game, as she has an air projectile too. 
Her non-throw supers have good range, too.

Throws
--------------

**Freeze**: F/B + (a+b)/(b+c)/(a+c) (Standing)

Marle pushes his opponent, then summons ice spikes to fall on 
her opponent.

**Siren's Kiss (inflicts Stop)**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Air). Requires 500 Power.

Marle brings out the Siren (Siren's Kiss in the DS version) and 
shoots at the opponent. It is a weaker weapon than her Valkyrie, 
but the opponent will be Stopped for a while if it hits. Seize 
the opportunity and rack up some damage!

Specials
--------

**Provoke**: F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing)

Marle taunts her opponent. If Marle gets hit by a non-throw attack 
during the taunt, she counters it by creating an ice statue that 
hits her opponent, freezing it.

**Aura**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing)

Marle uses her healing powers on herself (actual healing amount is 
5%). This move is slow, so use it on safe occasions.

**Ice**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing)

Marle creates a slow-moving ice flame that moves  will freeze her 
opponent. The button pressed determines the range and speed of the 
flame.

**Ice Spike**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Air)

Marle creates an ice spike in midair, that falls to the ground 
hitting any opponent it touches.


Supers
------

**Glacier Spikes**: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Marle creates three ice spikes in front of her, each one bigger than 
the one before it. 

**Ice 2**: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Marle creates two huge chunks of ice that fall in front of her.

**Guardia Soldiers**: ~D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

A super throw. Marle screams for help, knocking out her opponent. 
Soldiers come from offscreen (how did they get here?) and protect 
their princess.


Special Mode
------------

**Haste**: a+c (Standing). Requires 3000 Power.

Marle casts Haste on herself, boosting her movement and attack speed. 
She also can have up to two Ice flames and Ice Spikes on screen 
at the same time (as opposed to one).

Your Power will automatically decrease: when you run out of Power, 
the mode ends.

Final Move
----------

**Freeze Completion**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (must have Haste activated). Uses all of your Power, ending Haste.

A super throw. Marle creates ice puppets from her memories of women 
she knew. As she freezes her opponent, the puppets hit it too. 
This move probably looks weird if you don't get the reference.

"Dondeke!" "Deban de yo!"  "Bye Bye!"
