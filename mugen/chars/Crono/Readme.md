Crono by SilentProtagonist 
=========================

Crono is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's missing:

- More palettes.
- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)

Even if he's the main protagonist of the game, Crono was the last of the CT's 
cast that I brought into MUGEN. He has nice sprites for a few special and super
attacks, but I ran short anyways (that's why Volt Hit and Thundastorm are there). 

Trying to finish up his moveset was kind of hard because as a silent 
protagonist, Crono has almost no personality other than "hero".
As every player imagines Crono in their own way, I had to be careful not 
to force my own view of Crono.

I ended up doubling up on Frenzy/Confuse and adding a Spire-inspired
(pun not intended) Thundastorm. I hope they are adequate and Crono still
feels like you imagined him to be!

Crono's Moveset
==============

Crono should be your average character. His special moves allow him 
His projectile is very good but hard to hit with.
Her air strong attack, also, gives her good horizontal range.

Throws
--------------

**Cleave**: F/B + (a+b)/(b+c)/(a+c) (Standing)

Crono jumps on his opponent, stabs him and cuts him a la Dragon Tank.




Specials
--------------

**Lightning**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing).

Crono summons a lightning to fall from the sky. The button used determines the 
position of the lightning.


**Cyclone**: D, DB, B, + a/b/c (Standing)

Crono slowly advances while spinning. The button used determines his movement 
speed.

**Spincut**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Air)

Crono jumps in midair and makes a big cut with his sword. You can press an attack 
button to cut early.


**Volt Hit**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Air) Uses 250 Power.

Crono hits itself with lightning. A small spark will float near him and he will 
glow with energy. If Crono gets hit while in this state, he will not flinch (he will
take full damage, though) allowing you to counterattack, and the effect will end.

If you use Lightning while under the effects of Volt Hit, the summoned lightning will 
be bigger and do more damage, spending the Volt Hit effect.

Supers
------

**Luminaire**: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Crono floats and casts Luminaire around him.
    
**Thundastorm**: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Crono summons many lightning strikes in front of him, hitting his opponent
multiple times. Try to use this as part of a combo.

**Confuse**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing) Requires 1000 Power. 

Crono jumps and executes his Confuse attack if it hits the enemy, hitting 
multiple times.

This is a throw, so keep in mind it won't work against unthrowable enemies 
(bosses are an example).

Special Mode
------------

**Frenzy**: a + c (Standing). Requires 3000 Power.

Crono enters a constant Confuse-like state, having afterimages that follow him and
execute each one of his physical attacks. The afterimages are invulnerable. Try
to execute a big combo!

Your Power will automatically decrease: when you run out of Power, the mode ends.

Final Move
----------

**Shining Sword Attack**: D, F, D, B + a/b/c (Standing, must have Berserker activated). Uses all of your Power.

A super throw. Crono charges up electrical energy and advances towards its opponent. 
If the hit connects, he will launch them into the air before delivering a series 
of quick slashes, finishing with a huge lightning blast from his hand.

"It's time you understood who I really am!"
