Lucca by SilentProtagonist 
=========================

Lucca is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's missing:

- More palettes.
- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)


Lucca's Moveset
==============

Lucca isn't very agile nor fast. Her game revolves around summoning
robots and throwing projectiles to put some pressure on your opponent.
Her air strong attack, also, gives her good horizontal range.

Throws
--------------

**Shockwave**: F/B + (a+b)/(b+c)/(a+c) (Standing)

Lucca pushes her opponent, firing multiple hits with her Shockwave
at them.

**Hypnowave**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 500 Power.

Lucca uses her Hypnowave to make a single opponent fall asleep. 
The opponent has to be within range of the attack, obviously.
This attack actually doesn't do any damage, but if it hits, your 
opponent will be vulnerable for a bit of time (or until it gets hit).
Use this to your advantage!


Specials
--------------

**Napalm**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing).

A standard projectile thrown in an arc. It explodes by hitting 
either your opponent or the ground. Both the grenade and the explosion
deal damage. The speed and angle depend on the button pressed. 

**Fire Uppercut**: F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing).

Lucca advances a bit, throwing a fiery uppercut.

**Robot Call**: D, DB, B, + a/b/c (Standing)

Lucca brings out a remote control, using it to call help from a robot 
she repaired. The button pressed determines the summoned robot:

Pressing a calls a Bit that floats toward your opponent. It shoots
a missile that rises and then falls on your opponent.

Pressing b calls a Debuggest that walks toward your opponent and tries to 
shock it.

Pressing c calls a Proto-4 that either fires a missile towards your opponent 
or tries to shock them.

You can only have up one summoned robot at a given time.


Supers
------

**Gato!**: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Lucca summons Gato. He's had some practice, as he'll walk toward your 
opponent and try to punch him/her. You're free to move after Gato starts moving,
so try to team up with him! Gato will stop walking after a set time, 
so don't do this if your opponent is far away.
	
**Flare**: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Lucca executes the strongest Fire magic move. The flare will slowly advance
toward your opponent for a bit before dissapearing, and you can make it 
move up or down by pressing U or D.

**Gate Trap**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing) Requires 1000 Power. 

Lucca uses her Gate Key to open a Gate on the floor. If the opponent stands on it,
they will fall through it. You don't see what's on the other side of the Gate, 
but it sure sounds like it hurts.

The Gate stays open for a bit after you create it.

This is a throw, so keep in mind it won't work against unthrowable enemies 
(bosses are an example).

Special Mode
------------

**Protect**: a + c (Standing). Requires 3000 Power.

Lucca casts Protect on herself, improving her defenses. You'll receive less damage,
and attacks won't make you flinch, so you can go on the offensive without worrying 
about getting hurt.

Your Power will automatically decrease: when you run out of Power, the mode ends.

Final Move
----------

**Gate Key Summon**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing, must have Protect activated). Uses all of your Power, ending Protect.

Lucca uses her Gate Key to summon the Black Tyranno! It will appear over the closest 
opponent and bite down. Make sure it hits as you only have one shot. 

"AVAVAGO!"
