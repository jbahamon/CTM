Frog by SilentProtagonist 
================================

Frog is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's Missing:

- More palettes.
- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)

Frog was the first MUGEN character I made, so there's lots of badly 
written code in there. I went and fixed most of his issues, though 
(I hope).

My first version of Frog had double techs as supers, but then I saw it 
wouldn't make sense if, for example, you had Crono as a partner or 
opponent and used Spire/Lightning Rod, summoning another Crono.
I deleted all of that code and made new supers.


Frog's Moveset
==============

Frog is intended to be a combo-heavy character, more so in the air. 
Try to chain his moves, launch your opponent into the air and finish 
it with a super move!

He also jumps higher than other characters, and some of his moves 
either launch him into the air or can be executed in midair. 

However, his mixup capabilities are lower than for other characters. 
This means that most of his attacks can be blocked in any stance, so 
starting a combo could be difficult.


Throws
--------------

**Slurp Cut**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Standing) Requires 500 Power.

A special throw using Frog's tongue. The tongue's length depends on 
the button pressed.


Specials
--------

**Leap Slash**: F, D, DF + a/b/c (Standing).

Frog jumps over the enemy and stabs downwards.
The horizontal range of the jump depends on the button pressed.

**Water**: D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing/Air).

A slow projectile that stays on the screen for a while.
The bubble's movement and final position changes depending on the
button pressed.

**Line Slash**: D, DF, F + a/b/c (Air).

Frog stops in the air and flies forwards, stabbing the enemy. 


Supers
------

**Bubble Rush**: D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c (Standing/Air). Requires 1000 Power.

Frog releases many bubbles that float towards the opponent. These bubbles automatically
burst after a short while, so don't use this as a long-range super.

**Water Stream**: D, DB, B, D, DB, B + a/b/c (Standing/Air). Requires 1000 Power.

Frog creates a water pillar around him that hits many times.

**Mastermune**: D, F, D, B + a/b/c (Standing). Requires 1000 Power.

Frog jumps and tries to stab the oponent with the Masamune.
If it succeeds, Masa and Mune are free to do as they please
with the opponent. This is a throw move, so don't try it against
enemies immune to those.

Special Mode
------------

**Grand Dream**: a + c (Standing). Requires 3000 Power.

Frog unleashes Masa&Mune. It will follow you and attack as you do, 
spending Power with each hit it performs. You also lose Power when 
Masa&Mune gets hit. Masa&Mune will only dissapear When you run out 
of Power.

Use this mode to perform long combos!

Final Move
----------

**Frog Squash Da**: D, B, D, F + a/b/c (Standing, must have Grand Dream activated). Uses all of your Power, ending Grand Dream.

A super throw. Masa&Mune throws a barrage of punches and hits. If this move connects, 
a series of attacks will be unleashed on your opponent. 

"WRYYYYYYYYY".
